# Bug Fixes

 - Fixed a regression in the time plugin, introduced in 0.8, that caused dates
   to align to the minute rather than to the highest appropriate unit. This
   caused many x-axes in 0.8 to have different ticks than they did in 0.7.
   (reported by Tom Sheppard, patch by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1017, pull
   request #1023) +Fix

 - Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, that caused axis
   labels with the same text as another label on the same axis to disappear.
   More generally, it's again possible to have the same text in two locations.
   (issue #1032) +Fix

 - Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, where axis labels
   were no longer assigned an explicit width, and their text could not wrap.
   (reported by sabregreen, issue #1019) +Fix

 - Fixed a regression in the pie plugin, introduced in 0.8, that prevented it
   from accepting data in the format '[[x, y]]'.
   (patch by Nicolas Morel, pull request #1024) +Fix

 - The 'zero' series option and 'autoscale' format option are no longer
   ignored when the series contains a null value.
   (reported by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1033) +Fix

 - Avoid triggering the time-mode plugin exception when there are zero series.
   (reported by Daniel Rothig, patch by Mark Raymond, issue #1016) +Fix

 - When a custom color palette has fewer colors than the default palette, Flot
   no longer fills out the colors with the remainder of the default.
   (patch by goorpy, issue #1031, pull request #1034) +Fix

 - Fixed missing update for bar highlights after a zoom or other redraw.
   (reported by Paolo Valleri, issue #1030) +Fix

 - Fixed compatibility with jQuery versions earlier than 1.7.
   (patch by Lee Willis, issue #1027, pull request #1027) +Fix

 - The mouse wheel no longer scrolls the page when using the navigate plugin.
   (patch by vird, pull request #1020) +Fix

 - Fixed missing semicolons in the core library.
